# Goldblum

Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didnâ€™t stop to think if they should.

## Warning

Don't do this in production (or probably anywhere?). This is just a proof of concept. Seriously. It's not secure, it's not safe.

## What is it?

A golang webserver that allows live changes to its endpoints.

## Why?

To see if I could.

## How?

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Will give you an instance of Goldblum and a MySQL server.

Navigate in your browser to `http://localhost:8001/` to create your first endpoint.

Here's an easy one:

Set `Method` to `GET` and the endpoint to `/healthcheck` and the code to:

```golang
package main

import (
    "log"
    "net/http"

    gb "github.com/transitorykris/goldblum"
)

// Healthcheck is returned when the health of this service is requested
type Healthcheck struct {
	Status string `json:"status"`
}

// HealthcheckHandler returns the health of this service
func HealthcheckHandler() gb.HandlerFunc {
    return gb.HandlerFunc(func(ctx context.Context, w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        log.Println("Healthcheck called")
        gb.Response(w, &Healthcheck{Status: "ok"}, http.StatusOK)
    })
}
```

Now navigate to `http://localhost:8002/healthcheck` to test out your new endpoint.

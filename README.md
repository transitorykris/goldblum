# Goldblum

Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didnâ€™t stop to think if they should.

## Warning

Don't do this in production (or probably anywhere?). This is just a proof of concept. Seriously. It's not secure, it's not safe.

## What is it?

A golang webserver that allows adding new endpoints and modifying the source code for old endpoints live!

![Example screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/transitorykris/goldblum/master/images/example.png)

## Why?

To see if I could.

## How?

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will give you an instance of Goldblum and a MySQL server. It may take a few minutes the first time to come up.

Navigate in your browser to `http://localhost:8001/` to create your first endpoint.

Here's an easy one:

Set `Method` to `GET` and the endpoint to `/helloworld` and the code to:

```golang
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"

    gb "github.com/transitorykris/goldblum"
)

const page = "<html><body><h1>Hello, World!</h1></body></html>"

func Handler(g *gb.Goldblum, w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Fprintf(w, page)
}
```

Now navigate to `http://localhost:8001/helloworld` to test out your new endpoint.

Go ahead and head back to the editor and make a change to the endpoints source!

## Tell me more

### *gb.Goldblum

Your handler gets a sweet struct containing a connection to the database as well as a structured logger.

```golang
type Goldblum struct {
	DB  *sqlx.DB
	Log *logrus.Logger
}
```
